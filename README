My Ruby 1.9.2, Passenger/Nginx stack.

My roles:

  tasty-ruby-stack:
    role[basic-box]
    recipe[rvm::ruby_192]
    recipe[passenger::install]

  basic-box:
    recipe[build-essential::default]
    recipe[chef::bootstrap_client]
    recipe[chef::client]

I also have roles depending on tasty-ruby-stack, which 
deploy my apps from github repos and configure nginx
vhosts, workers, etc. YMMV.
